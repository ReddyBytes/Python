# Python-OOPs

`Object Oriented Programming ( OOPs ):` OOPs is a Programming Paradigm that organizes software design around objects.

Programming Paradigm : An approach used to solve the problems with code. A way or style of writing a code.  
`Types :`  
1. Imperative 
2. Declarative  
3. Functional
4. Logical , 

### Advantages of OOPs :
1. `Modularity:`  

__Definition:__ Modularity in OOP means dividing a program into separate, independent modules or objects. Each module performs a specific task and interacts with others through well-defined interfaces.  

__Benefit:__ This approach simplifies the development process by allowing developers to work on individual modules simultaneously without affecting the entire system. It also improves the maintainability of the code since changes in one module do not require modifications in others.  

2. `Reusability :` 

__Definition:__ Reusability refers to the ability to use the same code (objects and their methods) in different parts of an application or even in different projects.  

__Benefit:__ Reusability reduces the amount of code needed, speeds up development, and decreases the chances of errors. It leverages the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, enhancing efficiency and consistency across projects.  

3. `Extensibility :`  

__Definition:__ Extensibility in OOP is about adding new functionality to an existing system without altering its core structure. This is often achieved through inheritance, where new classes can inherit properties and methods from existing ones.  

__Benefit:__ Extensibility allows for the expansion of applications over time, accommodating new requirements or technologies seamlessly. It supports the evolution of software systems, making them more adaptable and sustainable.


### Class
class is a Blueprint/Plan to create objects which encapsulates both data(Attributes) and methods(functions).  
From the class we can create multiple objects  

__Naming convention for classes__ : Pascal case or upper camel case   
Ex :  `C`amel, `L`owe`C`ase, `B`ack`P`ack
